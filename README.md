Here's my simple instagram app, 

I specially covered the backend part with all the security and the functionality, I used Python: Uvicorn, FastAPI and PostgreSQL for the backend and React.js for the frontend (Used specially contexts to keep the app lean),

You can find the commands you need to turn on the server in the sub-folders, 

Hope you'll enjoy.
